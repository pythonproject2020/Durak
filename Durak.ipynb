        "This project is a variation of the card game Durak, played between one human player and an artificial intelligence player.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this version, both players are dealt 6 cards initially, and one additional card is drawn from that deck, who's suit represents the Trump Suit. The player starts by placing down a card, and the AI must place a card down that beats the previous card. \n",
        "\n",
        "Conditions for beating the current card are as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.) If the current card is not a trump card, it can be beaten by a card of the same suit and a higher rank, OR by any trump card.\n",
        "2.) If the current card is a trump card, it can only be beaten by a higher trump card.\n",
        "\n",
        "After the AI does this, the player must do the same, and both continue to do so until one player cannot or chooses not to beat the previous card. When this happens, the player who did not beat the previous card will take all of the cards that have been placed into the middle into their hands (except for trump cards which can only be used once in order to prevent a stalemate). \n",

        "The first player to get rid of all of their cards wins."
